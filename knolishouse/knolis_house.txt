The Philosopher
	Have you ever wondered about the meaning of life? I'm afraid I can't help you, but this role might give you some tools to help yourself.
	
The Cognitive Neuroscientist
	Ever wanted to be up-to-date on current research about the human brain, but never found the time and motivation for it? Then this role is for you.
	
The Mythologist
	Do you think the perfect meal is ambrosia and nectar? Is your ideal home on the top of a cliff? Have you ever heard of Zamolxis? If you answered "no" to all of these questions, play this role to find out what you're missing on!

	Congratulations! With all the knowledge you have acquired by now, I'm sure you will impress your friends, family, colleagues, your next date if you can get one, your pillow of tears otherwise, and so on. But can you impress the inhabitants of Knolis House too?
